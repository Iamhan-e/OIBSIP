<p>Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. From an early age he demonstrated an interest in computers and technology. At age 12 he created a video game called Blastar which he sold for $500. After moving to Canada at age 17, Musk attended Queen's University before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he received degrees in physics and economics.</p> 

<p>In 1995, Musk moved to California to attend Stanford University's graduate program but dropped out after just 2 days to found his first company Zip2, an online city guide. Zip2 was acquired by Compaq in 1999 for $307 million. Musk then went on to co-found X.com, an online financial services company that later became PayPal after merging with Confinity in 2000. PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
